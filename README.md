# Data Structures 

Welcome to my GitHub repository that contains my data structures codes! 
As a student who has just started data structures courses, I have created 
this repository to share my code implementations and demonstrate my understanding 
of the various data structures. In this repository, you will find 
a variety of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, 
trees, and graphs. Each data structure has been implemented using C. 
Feel free to explore my code and use it as a reference for your own data structures projects!
